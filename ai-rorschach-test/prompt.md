## Observations

The same question, asked in the exact same way, produced three radically different responses:

1. **ChatGPT**: Interpreted as a technical feasibility question
2. **Gemini**: Interpreted as an enterprise architecture planning question
3. **Claude Code**: Interpreted as a business decision question

This divergence forms the basis of "The Rorschach Test" data story.
